The signal sampling frequency is 16367600 Hz. The intermediate frequency is 4130400 Hz. In this record one 
signal sample is stored as one signed byte (int8). The record length is approximately 1 second and it was made in 2008.

These GPS L1 signals are present in this record (sorted from the strongest to the weakest):

[1] PRN 32 may not be acquired in the first millisecond of the record. This is most likely due to a bit transition 
in the navigation data.
[2] These PRNs require acquisition algorithms which are more sensitive than the default one (5 to 9 ms integration 
time is required).
